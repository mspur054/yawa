#YAWA - Yet another Weather App

This is a learning exercise while I'm am injured/sick POS and can't run.

The idea is to make a responsive weather app that provides clothing recommendations based on temperature, dew point, wind, relative effort of run, etc...

Features

- [x] Implement Canadian and American units
- [ ] Clothing Icons change depending on gender
- [ ] Graphs for wind, temp feel, dew point.
- [ ] Warnings when dew point/temp too high for tough workouts/races (You only need to have heat exhaustion once)
